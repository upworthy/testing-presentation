            Note:
            Those of you who have done some Rails will be familiar with RSpec.
            We'll see that JS testing is not that different from RSpec; many of the
            concepts are the same and a lot of the syntax is even pretty similar.
            Let's take a look at the tools that RSpec is made up of:

            - A test runner: the command-line utility that actually executes your test suite.
            - A test framework: the library you use to actually define your tests. If you're only
              used to RSpec, it might seem like your test runner and framework are the same thing,
              but that doesn't have to be the case.
            - Assertation libraries. RSpec supports several different syntaxes: we can use "should"
              or the more modern "expect" style assertations.
            - Mocks and stubs. Again, we can use the older "stub" or the more modern "allow", both
              of which let us stub out dependencies or make assertations on specific method calls.

           It's kind of the kitchen sink of testing.

            Note:
            In Javascript, things tend to be a little more modular. We'll use a different package
            for each of those things. Let's walk through an example and see where each piece plugs in.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section>
          <pre><code data-trim class="language-html">
          <button>Like this post on Fakebook!</button>
          </code></pre>

          <script type="text/template">
            Note:
            Let's imagine the following feature. We'll put this button on our nugget page, and when
            a user clicks it we'll do the following:

            1. Send a LIKE request to our newest social media outlet, Fakebook.
            1. Update the state of our JS application to record the fact that the user has liked us.
               Maybe we'll use this knowledge to show a thank-you message, or to prevent other Fakebook
               asks from appearing. Exactly what we'll do with this knowledge is beyond the scope of this
               example, but we at least know that we'll want to keep track of it.

            We'll assume that we're using React and Redux. And to begin, let's set up some basic application
            state to track whether the user has liked us yet or not.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">
          <pre><code data-trim class="language-js">
          const LIKED_PAGE = "LIKED_PAGE";
          const INIT_STATE = { liked: false };

          const reducer = (state = INIT_STATE, action) => {
            switch (action.type) {
            case LIKED_PAGE: return { liked: true };
            default: return state;
            }
          };
          </code></pre>

          Note:
          So this is our basic reducer. Our state only has one key, and the reducer only takes one action.
          Testing this should be equally simple. And because reducers are just plain functions, we can test
          them by simply calling them with arguments of our choosing, and asserting that the results are
          what we expect. We don't even have to involve Redux to test this.

            http://karma-runner.github.io

            Note:
            Karma is our test runner. When you do "npm test", it shells out to Karma under the hood.
            You probably won't interact much with Karma directly, unless you're changing how our test
            environment is set up, so I won't say too much about it.

              });

              describe("Might be nested", () => {
                it("Probably has multiple test cases");
                it("Is a good idea to organize big test suites");
              });
            });
            </code></pre>

            http://mochajs.org/

            Note:
            Our test framework is Mocha. This is how we define our tests; when Karma runs, it just executes
            all the Mocha tests. And a Mocha test looks a lot like an RSpec test: You can organize your tests
            into sections using "describe", and create individual test cases with "it".

            "Describe" and "it" both accept a label; this can be anything you want, but often for "describe"
            you'll use the name of the module or component under test. "It" might be a more detailed description
            of the specific behavior each test is exercising.

            It's important to note that Mocha doesn't provide any assertation or stubbing
            libraries. It's up to us to provide those.

          ## Testing tool #2: Chai.js

          import { expect } from 'chai';

          expect(1 + 1).to.equal(2);
          </code></pre>

          http://chaijs.com/
            Note:
            So if Mocha doesn't provide its own assertations, what do we use for that? The answer is Chai,
            which, like RSpec, provides a couple different syntaxes. We use the BDD-style "expect" assertation,
            because it's most similar to RSpec.

            And like RSpec, Chai can be extended to work with other tools. RSpec-Rails gives us helpers for
            controller and mailer tests; we will also use some Chai plugins for things like React.

              switch (action.type) {

              }
            };
            </code></pre>

            Note:
            So just for a refresher, here's our reducer again. And now that we have "describe", "it", and
            "expect" we can start writing tests for it.
          </script>
        </section>

        <section data-markdown>
          <script type="text/template">

                const state = reducer(undefined, { type: "ANYTHING" });
                expect(state).to.eql({ liked: false });
              });

              it('should set liked = true', () => {
                const oldState = { liked: false };
                const newState = reducer(oldState, { type: LIKED_PAGE });
                expect(newState).to.eql({ liked: true });
              });
            });
            </code></pre>

            Note:
            So what do we want to test here? Well, our reducer function handles to cases: creating the initial
            state when there is none, and updating the state in response to some user action. And like we said
            before, since this is a plain function, it should be pretty easy to test it.

            In the first test case, we're simulating the initialize action that Redux usually does for us. It
            doesn't really matter what we pass the reducer at this point; we just want to test that it returns
            the correct default state when one isn't already instantiated.

            The second test case exercises the LIKE_PAGE action that we set up for this reducer. In these two
            tests, we've covered all the cases of our reducer.

          http://airbnb.io/enzyme

          Note:
          We also know we want this button to be a React component, so let's talk about testing React.
          AirBnB released a library called Enzyme. It can be used to create components and test their
          markup, state, and behavior.

          Most often you'll use enzyme's "shallow" method. You can think of it as sort of equivalent
          to React.createComponent. It will instantiate a component, but just as "createComponent" will
          return a component that you still need to mount in the DOM, "shallow" won't actually mount
          your component either. Most of the time this is fine, but just be aware that you may find cases
          where you need the full mount behavior, in which case you can use enzyme's "mount" method instead.

          http://github.com/producthunt/chai-enzyme

          Note:
          Earlier I mentioned that Chai can be extended with plugins, and there's a good one for Enzyme.
          chai-enzyme gives us this "html" matcher. That said, this isn't a very useful test. For starters,
          it's kind of just testing that React is doing its job, which is redundant. Second, if I ever
          change the wording on this component, my test is going to break.

          So this test is brittle and uninformative. A better use of my testing effort would be to verify
          the actual behavior of the button. What happens when I click on it? That's the kind of thing
          that I want to know when it breaks.

            <button onClick={onClick}>Like this post on Fakebook!</button>;

          const likePage = () => ({ type: LIKED_PAGE });

          export default connect({ likePage })(FBButton);

            });
          });
          </code></pre>

          Note:
          Because we're using react and redux, we can assume we'll be using "connect" to inject our
          action creators into our component props.

          But that doesn't mean our test needs to use redux. Think about it this way: if our component
          is decoupled from app state and doesn't know or care what those injected event handlers actually
          do, then our test doesn't need to know either.

          So we can pass our unconnected component any generic function and as long as we can test
          that it was in fact called, our tests don't need to think about application state at all.
          And because we've already tested our reducer separately, when we replace this generic
          callback with an actual action creator, we can be confident that everything is going to work.

          (By the way, "simulate" is another chai-enzyme matcher.)

          </code></pre>

          http://sinonjs.org/

          Note:
          But sometimes we need a smarter stand-in than the one in the previous example. Maybe we want
          to check that a function was called with certain arguments, or not called at all. Maybe the rest
          of our code expects that event handler to return a specific value.

          This is where "test doubles" come in. You might be familiar with mocks and stubs from RSpec,
          but basically a test double is like a stunt double for your code. It stands in for the real thing,
          but it doesn't actually perform any real work. Doubles also record all the calls that were
          made to them, so you can verify later: were you called, what arguments were you passed, how many
          times were you called, and so on.

          So we use Sinon for our stubs, along with a chai plugin. "stub" creates a test double for us;
          with no arguments, it just returns an empty function that records method calls.

          Note:
          Doubles can do a lot more as we'll see next, but let's take a step back and imagine our
          Fakebook API. We'll pretend it works like this.

          There's not much here, but this actually complicates our tests quite a bit. First, "Fb.like"
          hits an external endpoint. Our tests definitely shouldn't be making ajax calls.

          Second, our app needs to know if the user has liked a page or not. We don't want to update
          app state if for instance, that ajax request failed.

          So if we don't want to actually make an ajax request, but we still rely on the result of
          an ajax call, how are we going to handle that in our tests?

          Note:
          Test doubles to the rescue. In addition to the bare stub we created in the last example,
          we can also stub out an existing method.

          With FB.like stubbed out, it's safe to simulate this click event. No AJAX call will be made.

          describe("&lt;FBButton />", () => {
            it("does not update state if `FB.like()` returns false", () => {
              const likePage = stub();
              const wrapper = shallow( &lt;FBButton likePage={likePage} /> );
              stub(FB, 'like').returns(true);

              wrapper.find('button').simulate('click');
              expect(likePage).to.have.been.called;
              FB.like.restore(); // Seriously, don't forget to do this.

          Note:
          We already know that we can stub an existing method. The only extra piece we need to
          make this test pass is actually telling our stub what to return. That way our stub
          behaves like the real thing, but we know it's safe to call and the rest of the code can
          still expect a proper return value.

          This is also a good example of the two most basic use cases for test doubles: 1) when
          you want to verify that a method was (or was not) called in a specific way; and
          2) when you want to stub out some side effects or dependencies to isolate your tests.

          Note:
          So that's tests in a nutshell! One thing to note is that at no point in our tests did
          we need to require Redux or its React bindings. But our reducer and component are fully
          tested. That's great! It means our app is well decoupled. Our components don't need to
          know anything about app state or how it's managed.

          We barely scratched the surface of what these tools can do, and I'd encourage you to
          spend a little time looking at the docs to see what's possible. That said, if there's
          one lesson I want to leave you with, it's this: listen to your tests. They're trying to
          tell you something. If it's really easy to test a piece of code, that's a great sign
          that you're doing something right. If you're having a hard time and your tests are hard
          to write, it doesn't mean you don't understand the test tools or that they're inadequate.
          That's a big flashing sign that says your code is too complicated. You should spend your
          time rewriting it in a way that makes your tests easier, rather than complicating your
          tests to match.
